This project is responsive.

You will need node.js to run this project.

Follow the below mentioned steps to run it

	$ npm install

	$ bower install

	$ npm install -g grunt-cli

	$ grunt serve

I have covered most of the major requirements and the rest can be done similarly using responsive bootstarp layout.

P.S.: The 'Watch video' button in the images at the bottom is done with plain css without any image file.
